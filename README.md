Script to use hosts file to block adds

This Script will use your /etc/hosts file to block trackers, ads, malware and more. It does it without the use of a browser add on 
and therefore can be used with any browser. Just run the script periodically or make it to where i will run every couple of weeks
or so. There are more trackers and such out there so feel free to add whatever.
